# Updates Needed
- jquery_update
- ckeditor dev

# Version 7.36.2a
Super platform sites were breaking - roots could not add products to cart
(created orders but orders had no line items) and ppm was wsod.  Hopefully
putting back contrib subdir fixes problem.

# Version 7.36.2
Security updates for views and mailchimp

# Version 7.36.1
media module breaks 7.35.1 (for one site)

7.x-2.0-alpha4+27-dev breaks ckeditor with undefined function.
This seemingly only happens on one site, I don't know why just one.
Media module should be downloaded from github/ahillio.
Last build happened prior to putting modules on github. 


*****


commerce and commerce_attributes_date both need to be patched
